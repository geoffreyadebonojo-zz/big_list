# BIG LIST

Big List helps you find and keep track of resources you want to use.

How to use:
Click the "+" button to add
a resource.
When a resource has been added the user can access it by clicking on the name of the resource in the item index.


TODO:

-some kind of error handling for if no images are present

-consider split page rendering for google links using scraper to split head and body
When the user clicks a link, currently that link opens in a new page.

-add placeholder image on item index page for if no image has been uploaded

-Add delete item option on the item show page.

When a user clicks save from the youtube show page,
it should save the video immediately
and redirect to a page with the video in an iframe (like the new video page, but without the button).
